## Description

This is a game where you have to memorize the positions of certain items, and match them
together as pairs. Each move consists of the player flipping over two cards. When all cards
are matched, player wins.

Win in less than 10 moves for the best star rating, less than 15 stars for two stars and
less than 20 for 1 star. Be careful, above 20, and you won't get a star!
